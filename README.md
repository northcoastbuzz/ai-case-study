# Case Study: Revenue Intelligence with Gong.io

## Overview and Origin

Gong was founded in 2015 by Amit Bendov and Eilon Reshef.  Prior to starting Gong, CEO Amit Bendov "held impressive portfolios like CEO of SiSense, CMO of Panaya, and Senior VP of Marketing at ClickSoftware." [^1]  Eilon Reshef, Gong's CTO, had previously founded Webcollage (now Syndigo).
Bendov's prior experience directly led to the idea for Gong, "after a 'quarter from hell' in which his sales pipeline shrunk without warning to tank revenues, Bendov came up with the idea for an AI-powered product that monitors sales decisions." [^2]

## Business Activities

Gong offers **Revenue Intelligence** tools targeted to sales professionals of mid-sized to enterprise-level companies in the B2B arena.

[MediaFly.com](https://www.mediafly.com/what-is-revenue-intelligence/) defines Revenue intelligence as:
>"The process of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting sales data to make informed business decisions. In today's sales environment, relying on gut instincts alone simply won't cut it. The slightest miscalculation can lead to lost revenue and missed opportunities."

According to [Gong's website](https://www.gong.io/revenue-intelligence/):
>Revenue intelligence solutions provide comprehensive visibility into buyer relationships and engagement activity across all touchpoints.
>Sales teams leverage AI-powered insights and automation to accelerate sales cycles, improve pipeline visibility, and provide a better buyer experience.

These tools include phone integration and call recording that uses, "natural language processing (NLP) to analyze conversations to identify topics discussed, talk patterns, questions asked, customer objections, sentiment, and more." [^1]  
Gong can then provide coaching and assitance to the sales associate with customer follow-up and e-mail generation using **Generative AI and Conversational AI**; as well as offering insights as to how close customers are to purchasing or if a sale are on the cusp of 
being lost based on the interations with the customer. Gong also offers integration with popular CRM applications like Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Hubspot as well as meeting sites like Zoom, GoToMeetings, and Webex.

Gong has grown steadily each year since it's founding and "has outsold the competition and represents over 75% of the revenue intelligence market." [^1]

## Recommendations

It's hard to provide recommendations to a company that has been so successful in its chosen market.  However, sales professionals are always looking for the next best tool to assist with the duties.  This includes the B2C arena which is currently not being targeted by Gong.  Marketing automation and Location-Based Mobile Marketing are two areas that excite B2C companies and if Gong can implement these functions using AI, 
then they could dominate both the B2B and B2C industries.
